  UI_PANEL_INFO_MAP: `<h5>Exploring in the map view</h5>

  <p>The map displays North Dallas geographic entities, each color-coded to show their score within the selected economic opportunity metric. The color scale has 5 blocks, each representing a quintile within the scale. The lighter the color, the higher the score.</p>

  <p>You can change the metric shown on the map by clicking the METRICS button and making selections. You can also use this feature to filter geographic entities on the map by quintile.</p>

  <p>The map also contains point features for a wide variety of neighborhood assets. You can enable and disable these point features by clicking the FEATURES button.</p>

  <p>To add feedback about a geographic entity or point feature, click that location on the map. A panel will open with a pre-populated form.</p>

  <p>You can also grab a snapshot of your screen using the camera button, and share a custom link to your current Explorer view via the SHARE buttons.</p>
